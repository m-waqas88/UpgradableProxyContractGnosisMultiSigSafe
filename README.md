# Upgradable Proxy Contracts using Gnosis Multisignature Safe
This is a demo project of Upgradable Proxy Implementation with 3 different ERC20 Token contract versions. The implementations are first scheduled and then executed using Gnosis MultiSignature Safe. Some of advanced solidity and ethereum concepts are implemented in this project.<br/>


## Tech Stack
1. Solidity
2. Ethereum
3. Openzeppelin
    - openzeppelin/contracts
    - openzeppelin/hardhat-upgrades
4. Erc20 Token
5. Hardhat (local development, smart contract verifications and deployment)
6. EthersJs (blockchain interaction)
7. Etherscan (to check functionality and verification of proxy implementation)
